											* Valentine’s Day is a painful reminder that you’re alone and suddenly you start missing all your ex’s. </br>
											* It hurts to have nobody to wake you with a kiss or bring you breakfast or surprise you with a romantic present.</br>
											* Your newsfeed is full of cute couple pictures and extravagant gifts. And no matter how hard you try to ignore them, they keep making you feel alone on Valentine’s Day.</br>

										"Anti-Romeo squad is a very good thing and it is being started in Uttar Pradesh again.
										 It should be welcomed as it is related to women safety. In my opinion, it should be started in Delhi also," said Manoj Tiwari.

										</header>
										<p>
											Anti-Romeo squads were constituted to check stalkers and eve-teasers in Uttar Pradesh soon after Yogi Adityanath assumed the office of the chief minister in 2017.</br>

However, they came under fire after self-appointed vigilantes started harassing couples in the name of protecting women.</br>

Several people had complained of a feeling of terror among youth due to the 'anti-Romeo squads' as some of them were made to shave their heads or do sit-ups for eve-teasing.</br>

After a recent spike in crimes against women in Uttar Pradesh, Yogi Adityanath ordered that the anti-Romeo squads be re-activated.</br>

Taking a cue from the UP CM, the Noida Police announced that it will issue "red cards" to offenders found harassing women in public places as a warning before initiating criminal proceedings against them if they are caught indulging in the act again, officials said on Thursday.</br>


										</p>
										<p>
											Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari is so impressed with the functioning of Yogi Adityanath's
											 anti-Romeo squads, he wants to institute them in Delhi.

											<h3>Rules for Anti Romeo Squard in our college</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											* Each team to consist of two policemen. Mostly one male and one female </br>
											* Two to three teams could be deployed in the jurisdiction of one police station</br>
											* They will move around near schools and colleges where there are a larger number of women</br>
											* Their task is to identify eve teasers and troublemakers in a crowd </br>
											* They will move around in uniform and in some cases in plain clothes. </br>
											* Teams would comprise constables, head constables, ASI and SI </br>
											* Anti romeo squads can let off miscreants with a warning, can inform parents and even initiate criminal action depending on the seriousness of the case</br>
											<b>At last I as a person, do feel that the Anti Romeo Squad should be there for women security and this decision is indeed a good one, but the process of narrowing down on ‘ROMEOS’ should be done in a much proper manner where the
											 innocent ones shouldn’t be harassed for no reasons. Senior responsible members of various civic societies should be deployed 
											along with such squads so that they can handle such situations in a proper way. Their judgment calls are apparently expected to work in a better way than someone else ability to become Desi Sherlock Holmes.</b></br>

										<h3><a href="#">What Are Anti-Romeo Squads? How Do They Operate?</a></h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										<b>Just two days after Yogi Adityanath took oath as the Uttar Pradesh CM, one of the BJP's oft-repeated promises during its election campaign was formation of anti-Romeo squads 
										"to protect the honour of women" took off with a great deal of purposefulness in the state. In its election manifesto for Uttar Pradesh, the BJP promised to create Anti-Romeo Dals (or squads) near colleges to 
										"ensure the safety of college-going girls" and "check eve-teasing".</b>

In a document that has communal overtones written all over it--the manifesto has brought up issues like the Ram temple, triple talaq and Kairana "exodus"--it is not difficult to see the kind of provocation the BJP is hinting at by creating an anti-Romeo squad.

									<b>The social media giant has failed on acting against the right-wing group because "cracking down on Bajrang Dal might endanger both the company's business prospects and its staff in India", the journal wrote. The latest report cited Facebook's actions related to a video by the Bajrang Dal which claimed responsibility for an attack on a church outside New Delhi in June.
