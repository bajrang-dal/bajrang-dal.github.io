										<h3><a href="#">Vishwa Hindu Parishad</a></h3>
									</header>
									<p>
									In the year 1984, Vishva Hindu Parishad decided to undertake ‘Ram-Janaki Rath yatra’ for
									 awakening the society on October 8, 1984. However there were threats from anti-Hindu and anti-social elements towards organizing this Yatra. 
									 In the wake of Uttar Pradesh Government refusing to give protection to Rath and the participants, the Holy saints gave a clarion call to the India’s Youth to protect the Holy Rath. Heeding to this call,
									  hundreds of Youth gathered in Ayodhya to stand in guard like ‘Mahavir Hanuman’ for the successful conduction of the holy event. They performed their duty very well and were well appreciated by one and all for their service.

										<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janaki_Mandir">Ram Janki Mata</a></h2>
										<p>
											However, post this the youths were motivated to continue their service and thus by the blessings of The Lord Ram, 
											Janaki Mata and the holy saints were born a group of Bajarangi’s under the name of ‘Bajarang Dal’.
										</p>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/pic16.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										Immediately after its formation, the Bajarangi’s set into the task of resurrecting the lost glory of the Holy City ‘Ayodhya’
										 by working towards reconstructing the temple of Lord Ram at his brith place. They duly joined the ‘Ram Janma Bhoomi’ movement.

									</p>
									<p><b> The results of formation of Bajarang Dal were amazing. Most of the young men were proud in getting themselves attached with Bajarang Dal. In 1986, it was decided to form Bajarang Dal in other states and very soon
									 Bajarang Dal was formed in other states too. The role of Bajarang Dal in Hindu Awakening is not a secret. 
									It successfully got the Hindu Youth involved in Ram Janma Bhoomi movement. It is evident from the tremendous success of various programmes, i.e., Shila Poojan, Ram Jyoti Yatra, Kar Seva of 1990 and Kar Seva of 1992.</p></b>

											<h3>Identity to Bajrang Dal</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											<b>The Karsewa on 30 October and 02 November 1990 gave an altogether different identity to Bajarang Dal. Such a youth power was associated with it that was absolutely not ready to tolerate any 
											symbols of insult to the Hindu society and which was prepared for any type of sacrifice for the protection of country and Dharma. Bajarang Dal had emerged before the public in the form of such an organisation, especially
											 after 06 December 1992, which was anxiously committed to the creation of a proud, self-respecting and valiant Hindu society. It was already decided that the young generation organised under the banner of Bajarang Dal was in no mood to compromise in any
											  way with the issue of security of the country, Dharma and society.</b>
										</p>
										<p>
											<b>That’s why the motto was set as Service, Security and Sanskar together with the maxim of ‘Where is rest for me until the cause of Ram is fulfilled’.

In conformity with the motto and maxim, the slogan ascribed to it was Jayakare Vir Bajarangi,</b></br><h3><b> Hara Hara Mahadev.</b></h3>

											<h3>Ideology and Agenda</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											Bajrang Dal is a right-wing organisation.
											 Among the goals of the Bajrang Dal in modern India is a reversing of the Islamic Invasions and British imperialism. 
											 They include demands to convert historical monuments currently disputed into temples. The organisation asserts on its website that they are neither communal or divisive.

The temple was demolished at 4am on Sunday. It was located on the road which is being redesigned only for pedestrians as part of the Chandni Chowk redevelopment plan. The structure was declared illegal by the high court and the order for its removal was passed in 2015.</b>
